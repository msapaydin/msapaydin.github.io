# OpenAI Dall-E 2

I was awarded access to the AI based image generation tool from OpenAI called Dall-E 2. 
It accepts as input detailed text and generates an image corresponding to the text. 
It is similar in spirit to OpenAI codex which accepts also a text string and generates code that is given in the query. 
As such, a new area of work called "prompt engineering" arose, which consists of finding the right prompt to generate the desired piece of code or the desired image.

Based on my experiments with Dall-E2, I can tell that it can be used with newspapers when illustrating a certain news article. 
For instance, I read Zulfu Livaneli in the newspaper called Oksijen, in Turkish. 
A couple of weeks ago he wrote an article about a visit by Ottoman Sultan Abdulaziz to the French city of Toulon. 
There was no picture in the newspaper article. So I tried various prompts to generate an image that reflects this historic visit. 
I came up with this:

![Image description](images/DALLÂ·E 2022-08-19 16.27.45 - a rendering of Ottoman Emperor Abdulaziz visiting France, arriving to Toulon with his fleet and being received by the French aristocracy .jpg)
The prompt was:

"a rendering of Ottoman Emperor Abdulaziz visiting France, arriving to Toulon with his fleet and being received by the French aristocracy".
