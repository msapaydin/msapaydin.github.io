I have started using two phones, one iphone 6, and one samsung note 9. The sim card is with iphone 6. The samsung note 9 has a large enough screen that I treat is like a 
super mini ipad. Furthermore, I disconnect the wifi on it whenever I want to disconnect and to focus. My main messaging app (signal) is also on the
android phone, enabling me to focus while working on something. Iphone 6 is so old phone that I cannot install too many things on it, forcing me to use
it as almost like a dumbphone. 
Highly recommended if you would like to focus on work without constant disruption!
