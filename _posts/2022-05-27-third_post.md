<h> Game AI vs. Industrial AI vs. academic AI </h>

I have been teaching artificial intelligence related classes since 2015. I have also consulted industry for AI. Recently, I have also started teaching AI in digital games.
What I can say that, even though the basics are the same, the AI for these three applications are different.

* For Game AI, the important thing is that the player has a nice time while playing the game. So for instance for planning the path of a non playable character (NPC), the motion planning algorithms could chat by looking into the position of the player from the game scene graph.

* For academic AI, the important thing is to invent a new optimization algorithm that can be used in deep neural networks for instance. Or, a way to decide on the number of hyperparameters of the neural network based from the data.

* For industrial AI, the important thing is practicality, and not necessarily to use the latest model. It is also of utmost importance to optimize business metrics, which may not be aligned with the metrics used in optimizing a machine learning algorithm for instance.

Most students in academia are focused on industrial AI. However, they are usually exposed to academic AI content in their AI classes.
Furthermore, even though some classes do exist which target industrial AI (such as EE543 that I have taught this semester at Izmir Institute of Technology based on fast.ai), these materials are also not exactly what you would expect in an industrial environment, where the business metrics are entering into the equations.

One can also see this from the linkedin tests which are testing for industrial AI mostly.
